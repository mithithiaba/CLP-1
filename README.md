Problem 1: Maximum of Three Numbers

This program takes three integers as input and finds the largest number using only if–elif–else statements.
Built-in functions like max() can not be used. If two or more numbers are equal, that value is returned as the maximum.

Problem 2: Digit Count and Digit Sum
